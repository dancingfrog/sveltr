## Shaders

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(warn = -1)
working_dir <- getwd()
print(working_dir)
if (!require("knitr")) {
    install.packages("knitr")
    library("knitr")
}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load reticulate package for running python
if (!require("png")) {
    install.packages("png")
}
library(png)
```

ESSL 300 provides two types of constants (*uniform* and *attribute*) and one type of variable (*varying*). The scope of a *uniform* (`uniform`) is global, available to all shaders in the program, while the scope of an *attribute* (`in`) is limited to the shader in which it is defined. The scope of a *varying* (`in` and `out`) bridges the shader in which it is defined and initialized with the shader in which it is received. There are multiple classes (*storage qualifiers*) available for uniforms, attributes and varyings, like:

    vec3
    vec4
    mat4
